# Practice_models
I have worked on daily bases to practice some models.
#Linear Model:
Here in the linear model, I have worked on a data to predict the next value for any input using training and testing model.
as in multiple linear regression the value of prediction value will be dependent on the various values that affect the most, as in my model the car_price_prediction is used as the car buying depends on its engine type, its dimentions, strokes, power and in many factors, so these values will also affect the price of the car.
#Logistic Regression:
Logistic Regression mainly used for classification of the model when telling about classification we mainly specify to YES or NO, 0 or 1, in this model decision is being made whether to go for something or leave it depends on its value.
